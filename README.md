# Zcash Address Fun Friday Initiative Playground!

This is a Fun Friday Initiative (FFI) to work with our Rust Crates, learn some programming and exercise our Foreign Function Interface Skills and hopefully come up with something useful as well!

If you are looking to do something with Zcash and you don't quite figure out what it could be, this is a good place to start!

I know what you are thinking of! Nope! This is not production ready code! ^^

## Goals

Create a UNI-FFI library that uses the librustzcash crates to:
- validate Unified, Sapling and Transparent Addresses
- HD Wallet Derivation for Zcash Addresses
  - Derive a transparent address from Seed bytes for account n and index i
  - Derive a Sapling Shielded address from Seed bytes for account n and index i
  - Derive a Unified Address from Seed bytes for account n and index i
- Provide a way simple API that can be used in many languages like Javascript, Python, Ruby, Kotlin, Swift, Java, C++, you name it!
- Have Fun
